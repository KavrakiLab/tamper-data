### Description
# gelatin and Macaroni are stacked. We expect to see the robot move cracker to the goal
# location, and unstacks gelatin and stacks it over the cracker. If motion constraints
# suggest that cracker cannot be reached due to gelatin, more steps required

### TAMP Options
abstraction: "pddl" # pddl, mdp
model_spec: "file" # server, file, rgbd
perception: "rgbd" # server, file, real
perception_module: ["vicon", "dope"] # Specify all you want to use from <vicon, dope,>
occlusion_ratio: 0.6

# idtmp encoding means we apply a discretization to locations
# sampling encoding is for single-robot with regions and locations
# mrtamp encoding is for multi-robot with regions and locations
# duster encoding is for multi-robot with cleaning task
encoding: "sampling" # idtmp, sampling, mrtamp, duster, drawer

### Obstacles

# For idtmp, all tables will be discretized into grid locations
# grid_size: 0.1

region:

location:
  - name: "goalfront"
    parent_object: "table1"
    width: 0.03 # side length in x

### Objects
objects:
  - name: "cracker"
    vicon_model_path: "package://onto/resources/simulation/vicon_object_server/objects/cracker.yaml"
  - name: "gelatin"
    vicon_model_path: "package://onto/resources/simulation/vicon_object_server/objects/gelatin.yaml"
  - name: "macaroni"
    vicon_model_path: "package://onto/resources/simulation/vicon_object_server/objects/MacaroniAndCheese.yaml"

### Task Planning
goal: "(and (at cracker goalfront) (at macaroni goalmiddle) (at gelatin goalback))"
domain_pddl: "tamp_exec/pick_place_region_domain.pddl"

# If this object is occluded, force the goal orientation in world frame to be this
# Unoccluded objects' goals' orientation are determined by its start pose for now
goal_pose:
  - name: "cracker"
    location: "goalfront"
    orientation: [0.5, -0.5, 0.5, -0.5]
  - name: "macaroni"
    location: "goalmiddle"
    orientation: [0, 0, 0.707, 0.707]
  - name: "gelatin"
    location: "goalback"
    orientation: [-0.5, 0.5, -0.5, 0.5]
