### Description
# Popcorn in the drawer. We expect to see ...

### TAMP Options
abstraction: "pddl" # pddl, mdp
model_spec: "file" # server, file, rgbd
perception: "rgbd" # server, file, real

# idtmp encoding means we apply a discretization to locations
# sampling encoding is for single-robot with regions and locations
# mrtamp encoding is for multi-robot with regions and locations
# duster encoding is for multi-robot with cleaning task
encoding: "drawer" # idtmp, sampling, mrtamp, duster, drawer

### Objects
objects:
  - name: "gelatin"
    vicon_model_path: "package://onto/resources/simulation/vicon_object_server/objects/gelatin.yaml"
  - name: "popcorn"
    vicon_model_path: "package://onto/resources/simulation/vicon_object_server/objects/Popcorn.yaml"
  - name: "macaroni"
    vicon_model_path: "package://onto/resources/simulation/vicon_object_server/objects/MacaroniAndCheese.yaml"

### Task Planning
goal: "(and (at gelatin goalleft) (at popcorn goalmiddle) (at macaroni goalright))"
# goal: "(and (at macaroni goalright) (at popcorn goalmiddle))"
# goal: "(and (at gelatin goalmiddle))"
domain_pddl: "tamp_exec/block_drawer_domain.pddl"

# If this object is occluded, force the goal orientation in world frame to be this
# Unoccluded objects' goals' orientation are determined by its start pose for now
goal_pose:
  - name: "gelatin"
    location: "goalleft"
    orientation: [-0.707, 0.0, 0.0, 0.707]
  - name: "popcorn"
    location: "goalmiddle"
    orientation: [0.707, 0.0, -0.707, 0.0]
  - name: "macaroni"
    location: "goalright"
    orientation: [0, 0, 1.0, 0.0]
